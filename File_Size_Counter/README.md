Script just print the files in /etc dir if their names have letter 'a' on the second position.
In the end it prints totall size of the files in bytes.

Firstly, script length was 335 symbols, I've tried to update it. It's 180 symbols longs now.

Output example:
```$ ./file_size_counter.sh 
/etc/bash.bash_logout
/etc/pacman.conf
/etc/man_db.conf
/etc/gai.conf
/etc/mail.rc
/etc/passwd
/etc/papersize
/etc/passwd-
/etc/mailcap
/etc/passwd.pacnew
/etc/nanorc
/etc/bash.bashrc
/etc/machine-id
/etc/makepkg.conf
37965```
